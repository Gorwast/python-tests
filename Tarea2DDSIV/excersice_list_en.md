# Assignment 2 System Development IV

1. Write a program with a function that displays the string: Hello World; every time it is invoked.
2. Implement a program that requests the user's name, passes the string "name" to a function and displays the greeting "hello name".
3. Write a program that calculates the factorial of a number in a function, that receives a positive integer and returns its factorial.
4. Write a program with a function that receives a list of 10 integers and returns another list with its squares.
5. Calculate area of triangle or rectangle:
   - Have it ask if you want to calculate the area of a triangle or a rectangle, ask for the base and the height. You must ask the user that you want to calculate, depending on the option selected, to call the method areaTriangle or areaRectangle, these must return the result, to print
   - Methods: one to calculate the area of the triangle and another to calculate the area of the rectangle, the base and height receive them by parameter, each method must return the result.
6. Ascending or descending order:
   - The program should ask for the values of a list of 5 integers, and ask if you want it to be sorted in ascending or descending order.
   - Implement 2 methods, one to sort the list in ascending order and another to sort the list in descending order, the values are received by parameter. Print result.
7. Request 2 numbers, order them from more to less or check if they are multiples:
   - The program requests two numbers, ask if you want to order them or say if they are multiples, depending on the selected option, call the order method or multiples.
   - Implement 2 methods, one to find the largest of 2 numbers and another to determine if 2 numbers are multiples, the 2 numbers are received by parameter. Print the result.
8. Convert string to upper or lower case:
   - Develop a program that requests a string, asking if you want to convert it to upper or lower case, depending on the option to send it as a parameter to the upper or lower case method, which will return the converted string and print it
